== Version 60000.3
Update to latest BSF library.

== Version 60000.2
* Fixed Dark Intent flashing.  (Thanks Targenor!)

== Version 60000.1.1
* Implemented 6.0 Affliction warlock rotation.

This is only lightly tested, but seems to work.  I am not expert at the spec,
so feedback on improving the rotation is very, very welcome.

== Version 60000.1.0
* Reindent, utf-8-unix encoding, 3-space lua indents.
* New author: SlippyCheeze
  - Thanks to Xemnosyst for all his amazing work!
* Clean up the spell IDs for removed spells.
* Implement 6.0 Destruction warlock rotation.
* Implement 6.0 Demonology warlock rotation.

== Version 50400.1.5
* I have gotten a pretty good response, so I think (and hope) Bitten's SpellFlash will live on!

== Version 50400.1.4
* The future of Bitten's SpellFlash: Warlock is in question.  I no longer wish to maintain this addon, starting with patch 6.0.  If you are interested in taking it over, keeping up with optimal rotations, and you have programming skills, please leave a comment or PM on Curse.

== Version 3.6.4
NOTE: This version includes a new version of Bitten's SpellFlash Library that I tried to test well, but if you find any issues please let me know right away.

NOTE: Your options will be reset when you upgrade to this version.
* Upgraded to the latest Bitten's SpellFlash Library.
* Several other internal changes.
* Destruction: Factors in the new Glyph of Ember Tap when deciding whether it should flash.
* All: Now flashes Dark Intent if anyone in your raid needs the stamina buff (or the spell power buff, as always).
* All: No longer flashes Soulstone if you are queued for a dungeon/raid.

== Version 3.6.2
* Bear with me - I'm learning this new packaging system.  I think this time the debug output should be removed.

== Version 3.6.1
* No change, just releasing out of beta (see last version for the real changes).

== Version 3.6.0 beta
* Repackaging so that Bitten's SpellFlash Library is included with the addon, instead of downloaded separately.

* Demonology: Made Felstorm and Wrathstorm flashing behave a little better (they were flashing early at times).
* Demonology: Bugfix - Grimoire: Felhunter was not flashing.
* Demonology: Bugfix - Aura of the Elements was flashing even when it was on cooldown.

== Version 3.4.1
* Affliction: DoT dps is now tracked per-target, so the pretty colors now work when multi-dotting.
* Affliction: Bugfix (I hope) - Corruption was sometimes never flashing because of a bug in Soulburn + Seed of Corruption detection.

== Version 3.4.0
* Affliction: Super-cool green/yellow/red flashing for DoTs now.  Check the description page for what they mean and how you should respond.
* Affliction: Traded the priority of Corruption and Unstable Affliction unless corruption will expire otherwise.
