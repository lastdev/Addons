    checkpoint: still fails BUT i've finally found the cause: the BagFrame objects shift position between when I attach the click-handlers and when the use clicks / triggers those handlers.  Thus, the lexically scoped variables contain stale data.  ALSO, the slots onto which I hook handlers may no longer actually contain the pet, and it may have moved into a slot that was previously empty and thus was never hooked.
