
Reagent Banker v1.0.2
==============================

Author: Tuhljin

Reagent Banker simplifies usage of the Reagent Bank. It is easy to use yet highly configurable. Current features include:

* Automatically deposit reagents when you visit the bank. Hold down a key to prevent deposit. -OR- Hold down a key to trigger a deposit.
* Open directly to the reagent tab instead of the default bank. (Do this by default or only when a key is held down.)
* Optionally deposit from bags regardless of whether they are flagged as Ignored by WoW's "Clean Up Bags" (sorting) feature.
* Optionally output item links and their counts when any are deposited by Reagent Banker or the "Deposit All Reagents" button.
