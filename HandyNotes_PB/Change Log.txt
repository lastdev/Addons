* Please note that I'm aware of some placeholder guide/text.
  It's ready for a future big content update. Step by step

  due to incompatibility with Classic Mists. This AddOn
  now uses my Dragons Tread Lightly, which is a performance
  gain and enhancement anyway
* Dragons Tread Lightly now has increased accuracy for
  Classic Mists: What you will see will be a very small increase
  in precision on the continent maps and bigger improvement on
  the Azeroth map. DTL v1.03

* Added another HandyNotes Refresh() delay for logins (both new and character swap),
  reloads, and loading screen situations (various - enter/exit instances or Mage

  server glitches, too many AddOns, potato PCs
