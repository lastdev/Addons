== v2.02 - 10th October 2025
* Versioning support. Can now abandon old defaults as necessary. This
  code will obviously change over time as necessary but the system is
  in place. Functions_Common.
* Individual pin scaling
* Fix for Events module. Block from ARH AddOn accidentally in Options_Events
* Allow for "" text (as well as nil) in tips and guides

== v2.01 - 9th October 2025
* Improved logic for CompletionFormatAndShow and AddOnEventTooltipLines
* Bug with character headers not showing completion - Functions_Events
* Translated verbose Tooltip to explain that character based pin removal
  on achievement (criteria) being completed is difficult/impossible in
  WoW since 10.0.0+.
* Better use of ns.aoa table
  ^ All above due to struggles to provide a turn-key and ACCURATE system
  for reporting PER CHARACTER achievement completion in the retail era
  of Warbanding / shared achievements where the data just isn't available.
  ^ All of the above for the Events sub-module.
* New texture indexing system. More flexible, with the future in mind.
* A bug with the way this AddOn works with HandyNotes. It appears that a
  Refresh pins fires before the AddOn is fully loaded. Happened on one
  char only and was intermittent and only for a char load. Reload etc not
  a problem. Resolved by ensuring that all required ns. variables have
  been defined in the main body of each .lua file. ns.cluster = {} in
  Functions_Common found to be the culprit. Monitor.
  
== v2.00 - 8th October 2025
* Released with the PB AddOn. Prior MMPT was very similar

== Previous
* No versioning. Evolved with use in Event based AddOns and EAP AddOn.
