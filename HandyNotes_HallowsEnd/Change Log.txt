== v4.06 - 2nd August 2025
* TOC update to 11.2.0

== v4.05 - 20th July 2025
* Options to remove one time / daily quests after completion
* Option to not show pins on the Azeroth map (it can get rather crowded!)
* Further modularisation of Hallow's End
* Now partially overrides HN module Here Be Dragons
  due to incompatibility with Classic Mists. This AddOn
  now uses my Dragons Tread Lightly, which is a performance
  gain and enhancement anyway
* Various pin movements/changes to accomodate Classic Mists
* Dragons Tread Lightly now has increased accuracy for
  Classic Mists: What you will see will be a very small increase
  in precision on the continent maps and bigger improvement on
  the Azeroth map. DTL v1.03
* Azeroth map pins now correct for Classic Mists due to all of the above
* TOC update to 3.4.5
* TOC update to 11.1.7
* Khaz Algar continent pins are no longer visual guestimates for the zone
  pins: they really are rippled up to their parent continent from the zone
  due to using my DTL module

== v4.04 - 18th June 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.5
* TOC update to 3.4.4
* Classic Mists 5.5.0 added!

== v4.03 - 20th April 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.5

== v4.02 - 10th April 2025
* Pin cluster with every achievement covered. Added to every continent map
* Rarely encountered space line bug fixed
* Trivial code formatting change in popup Minimap menu
* Server/realm list updated

== v4.01 - 31st March 2025
* Further tweaks to options. Renaming, translating, added a mention about a console command, etc
* Further modularising of the code. Colours
* Removed some unnecessary localisations
* Adjusted a note/reminder about why I use one of two viable (at least in retail)
  means of obtaining a localised quest name
* Cosmetic change to highlighted text in the AddOn menu
* Stranglethorn Buckets shunted around a bit for Horde
* Dalaran and adjacent zones all coordinates adjusted for Classic Cataclysm AND Retail
  Over time Dalaran has shifted around slightly:
  Between Classic Cata and Dragonflight it has drifted a little to the South-east.
  Sometime after Dragonflight it has had a further, smaller shift to the south-east
  but with an additional small anti-clockwise rotation. This throws off all Dalaran coordinates
  with respect to other zones. Interestingly The Underbelly coordinates remain as is always.
  It didn't move but the open air surface above did move! Someone stuffed up at Blizzard lol.
  (Proof is in my October 2022 v1.05 release: I don't imagine those coordinates or pluck em out of the air
  or copy paste off dodgy website data. I literally stand on top of the Candy Bucket myself!)
* All Northrend data slightly changed for Classic Cataclysm to reflect versioning

== v4.00 - 24th March 2025
* Complete coding makeover
* Better Tooltip design
* New colour scheme
* Better map phase detection/messages
* Locations tweaked for various pins. Eg: Azure Watch
* Works around the erroneous data returned by GetAchievementCriteriaInfo
* Lots of small errors found adn corrected. Eg: Darkbreak Cove misplaced in Vashj'ir
* Removed most advertising for my other AddOns. A couple remain
* Removed the hack to force pins to propagate upwards as the problem is now resolved
* Every Guide and Tip were reviewed and improved

== v3.22 - 27th February 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.0

== v3.21 - 20th February 2025
* TOC update to 4.4.2

== v3.20 - 2nd February 2025
* Better Refresh delay to prevent that annoying GetAchievementCriteriaInfo abend

== v3.19 - 13th January 2025
* Added another HandyNotes Refresh() delay for logins (both new and character swap),
  reloads, and loading screen situations (various - enter/exit instances or Mage
  teleport, etc). This will assist players with slow internet, unusual Blizzard
  server glitches, too many AddOns, potato PCs
  Note: This is a preemptive change due to one report for another of my AddOns
	
== v3.18 - 30th December 2024
* Alliance Theramore pins - bug fix
* Upvalue for GetTime added

== v3.17 - 20th December 2024
* An abend might occur for a GetAchievementCriteriaInfo() call during a load screen,
  resulting in a nonsense LUA error message. Simple solution: the Minimap refresh
  delay is extended from 3 to 7 seconds.
  Note: This is a preemptive change due to one report for another of my AddOns

== v3.16 - 10th December 2024
* TOC update to 11.0.7

== v3.15 - 26th November 2024
* Minimap pins now disappear/appear around the same time as they do on the World Map
  I arbitrarily set the timer to checking every 3 seconds - to avoid FPS / DPS hits
  If show/hide via the options panel then that's instant
  If in combat then I rely wholly on the HandyNotes engine to avoid taint errors
  (a main reason I moved to the HN ecosystem years ago)
* Maladath added to the OCE server list

== v3.14 - 12th November 2024
* TOC update to 4.4.1

== v3.13 - 7th November 2024

== v3.05 - 28th October 2024
* Improved logic for Summary displays

== v3.04 - 27th October 2024
* Dragon Isles is now a Summary on the Azeroth map - less clutter!
* Pandaria too
* Suppress coordinates for summary pins
* Removed a whole lot of unnecessary Continent filling code ( collating all pins from zone children)
* Reworked the logic for deciding whether a pin will be shown or not

== v3.03 - 26th October 2024
* Remove stray Khaz Algar pin from Classic Cataclysm

== v2.01 - 31st October 2022
* The base HN tools don't really seem to allow for duplicate coordinates. This poses a problem for me as my data structure has duplicate coordinates - one for Alliance, one for Horde. One manifestation of the problem is missing continent markers for one faction. Zones too but that was fixed in v2.00. I've now overcome the continent problem. I still need to ensure there are no duplicates at the zone level though. I'll live with that.
* With the above work I now need not fear missing markers on the Azeroth map, as has happened although I doubt anyone noticed as there were so many anyway already lol.
* Stranglethorn Vale "sub-continent" has been added back in. It was dumb to have removed it.
* The Garrison mission for Hallow's End has been added. I've never seen it myself but apparently it's still in the game.
* A typo for Refuge Pointe.
* I removed localisation of most API calls to avoid taint.

== v2.00 - 30th October 2022
* You now have the option to
(1) remove a marker if your account has ever completed it
(2) remove a marker if your character has ever completed it
(3) remove a marker if completed this season
* Numerous changes to the data file - corections to quest ID, tweaking coordinates, tooltip help tweaking, new data format for dailies / non-achievement buckets.
* World map displays now complete - data fully passed up from zones and continents
* With the inclusion of the mysterious Stonetalon Mountains crate (not part of an achievement), Theramore, Boralus, Garrison seasonal and dailies, etc the AddOn has literally 100% of all the Candy Buckets

== v1.06 - 26th October 2022
* Added Old Theramore
* Updated the game version to 10.0.0
* Several other titivations of which I don't recall the details. Slight position movements mostly.

== v1.06 - 25th October 2022
* As usual, lot's of refinements.
* The marker for Boralus in map 1161 was missing. It's there now!

== v1.05 - 23rd October 2022
  (What the hell happened between this release and the previous one. Release notes are identical. WTH lol)
* So many changes.... the main ones:
* Added a 3rd icon for "Other" or "miscellany". Specifically those candy buckets which are not a part of any achievement.
* Help for Draenor and Broken Isles now included for those completionists.
* Some Northrend Horde were rough as based off memory (lol). I've now completed a sweep of all achievement continents for both factions.

== v1.04 - 23rd October 2022

== v1.03 - 21st October 2022
* Way to many tweaks and polishes to note. I'd say I'm pretty much done with Cataclysm, Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor for both factions for the time being.
* For example I made notes about how to easily access Deepholm and Vashj'ir. Added a bit of fun trivia.
* Almost every Azeroth location has had its coordinates adjusted a hundredth of a point or two because I'm like that lol.

== v1.02 - 20th October 2022
* Pandaria and Northrend have been polished
* Coordinate tweaking
* comments too

== v1.01 - 18th October 2022
* Vashj'ir help needed a bit of polish
* Likewise the Daily quests

== v1.00 - 18th October 2022
* Initial release. Wooo!
