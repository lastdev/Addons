== v2.01 - 31st October 2022
* The base HN tools don't really seem to allow for duplicate coordinates. This poses a problem for me as my data structure has duplicate coordinates - one for Alliance, one for Horde. One manifestation of the problem is missing continent markers for one faction. Zones too but that was fixed in v2.00. I've now overcome the continent problem. I still need to ensure there are no duplicates at the zone level though. I'll live with that.
* With the above work I now need not fear missing markers on the Azeroth map, as has happened although I doubt anyone noticed as there were so many anyway already lol.
* Stranglethorn Vale "sub-continent" has been added back in. It was dumb to have removed it.
* The Garrison mission for Hallow's End has been added. I've never seen it myself but apparently it's still in the game.
* A typo for Refuge Pointe.
* I removed localisation of most API calls to avoid taint.

== v2.00 - 30th October 2022
* You now have the option to
(1) remove a marker if your account has ever completed it
(2) remove a marker if your character has ever completed it
(3) remove a marker if completed this season
* Numerous changes to the data file - corections to quest ID, tweaking coordinates, tooltip help tweaking, new data format for dailies / non-achievement buckets.
* World map displays now complete - data fully passed up from zones and continents
* With the inclusion of the mysterious Stonetalon Mountains crate (not part of an achievement), Theramore, Boralus, Garrison seasonal and dailies, etc the AddOn has literally 100% of all the Candy Buckets

== v1.06 - 26th October 2022
* Added Old Theramore
* Updated the game version to 10.0.0
* Several other titivations of which I don't recall the details. Slight position movements mostly.

== v1.06 - 25th October 2022
* As usual, lot's of refinements.
* The marker for Boralus in map 1161 was missing. It's there now!

== v1.05 - 23rd October 2022
* So many changes.... the main ones:
* Added a 3rd icon for "Other" or "miscellany". Specifically those candy buckets which are not a part of any achievement.
* Help for Draenor and Broken Isles now included for those completionists.
* Some Northrend Horde were rough as based off memory (lol). I've now completed a sweep of all achievement continents for both factions.

== v1.04 - 23rd October 2022
* So many changes.... the main ones:
* Added a 3rd icon for "Other" or "miscellany". Specifically those candy buckets which are not a part of any achievement.
* Help for Draenor and Broken Isles now included for those completionists.
* Some Northrend Horde were rough as based off memory (lol). I've now completed a sweep of all achievement continents for both factions.

== v1.03 - 21st October 2022
* Way to many tweaks and polishes to note. I'd say I'm pretty much done with Cataclysm, Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor for both factions for the time being.
* For example I made notes about how to easily access Deepholm and Vashj'ir. Added a bit of fun trivia.
* Almost every Azeroth location has had its coordinates adjusted a hundredth of a point or two because I'm like that lol.

== v1.02 - 20th October 2022
* Pandaria and Northrend have been polished
* Coordinate tweaking
* comments too

== v1.01 - 18th October 2022
* Vashj'ir help needed a bit of polish
