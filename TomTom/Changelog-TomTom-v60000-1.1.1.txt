--------------------

Jim Whitehead:
	- Fix an issue with corpse waypoints
	- Properly fork Astrolabe to prevent conflicts
	- De-duplicate zone names to fix fuzzy searching
	- Update Astrolabe
	This is a forked version that fixes an issue with zone mappings but will
	be overridden by a new version of Astrolabe if made available.
