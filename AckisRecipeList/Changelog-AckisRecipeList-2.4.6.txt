--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Do tooltip cleanup when the list frame hides, instead of when the main panel does. Nil out the selected_entry as well.
	- Hide the acquire and spell tooltips when the main panel is hidden.
	- The plus/minus buttons next to list entries no longer show tooltips, and are now the only way to expand/collapse entries. Clicking on an entry will now select it, and make its tooltip sticky until it is unselected or another entry is selected. The tooltip now has a scrollbar - selecting an entry allows it to be used.
	- Cleanup.
