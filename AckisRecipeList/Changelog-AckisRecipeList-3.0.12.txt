--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Profession modules are now responsible for allocating entity item_list and recipe acquire_data tables.
	- Added a helper function to get rid of duplicate location-handling code.
	- Some variable name changes for clarification.
	- Updated call to AddRecipe to use the new method.
	- Refactored AcquireType:AddEntity() to take a module and an entity as parameters: It is now the caller's responsibility to generate the entity.
	- Re-added a mining/smelting check with a comment on why it's needed.
	- Reworked addon:AddRecipe() to use module and recipe tables passed in from the profession module AddOns.
	- Added GAME_VERSION_NAMES to constants table for module access.
	- professionModule.version => professionModule.Version
	- Added module version checking. Modules with a non-matching version will be inoperable.
	- Updated MODULE_ERROR_FORMAT to clarify that the error is a missing or disabled profession module.
	- Removed comments which explained what TRADE_SKILL_SHOW and TRADE_SKILL_CLOSE accomplish...
	- Another MINING_PROFESSION_NAME/PROFESSION_MODULE_NAMES change.
	- Remove check for MINING_PROFESSION_NAME since PROFESSION_MODULE_NAMES handles it implicitly.
	- Map MINING_PROFESSION_NAME to "Smelting" in PROFESSION_MODULE_NAMES.
Ressy:
	- Add Murg Stonecrack
