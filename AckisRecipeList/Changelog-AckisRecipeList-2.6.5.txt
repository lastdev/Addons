--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Don't require an acquire_type when creating a Waypoint - fixes Ticket #1613
	- Formatting fix.
	- Dead code removal.
	- Since the state_button's highlight texture is the same no matter its expanded state, set it outside the if-check.
	- Added name comments to AddReputation calls.
	- Added "reputations" dump command.
	- Check for 0 lines when dumping boss names, and insert message if so.
	- Removed useless comments, such as "COMPLETELY UPDATED" - when? During TBC? Wrath? Cata?
	- Removed code for generating TradeSkill links, since Blizzard broke this functionality in September of 2013 and has shown no signs of fixing it.
