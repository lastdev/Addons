* Brewmaster: Elusive Brew now flashes a normal yellow color even at 10 stacks (was red).

* Mistweaver and Brewmaster: Expel Harm is now used when you are under 80% health (was 85 or 90, depending on spec).
* Windwalker: Added level 30 talents (because they changed w/ 5.2).

* Windwalker: Added an option to synchronize Tigereye Brew with a mastery proc.  See the website for more info (especially if you have the Rune of Re-Origination).
* Windwalker: Fists of Fury now flashes small and yellow if Energizing Brew is off cooldown, to make you less tempted to press them both at the same time.
