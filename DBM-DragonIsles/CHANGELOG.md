## [10.1.20](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/tree/10.1.20) (2023-08-01)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/10.1.19...10.1.20) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- Do a forced update for retail (that'll disable dbm if it's not updated within 24 hours of this tag) to fix a pretty critical bug on echo of neltharian that caused some of the WAs not to work correctly (and if this had been reported weeks ago, would have been fixed weeks ago too, again can't emphasize that reporting bugs is critical)  
- Fixed a critical bug where volcanic heart had wrong timer all of stage 1 by about exactly half.  
- Update localization.tw.lua (#256)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#258)  
- Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Unified  
- Update localization.tw.lua (#254)  
- Some basrikron fixes while at it since I had to solo it earlier and had about 15 minutes worth of data to look at.  
- Removed redundant alert  
- I thought I pushed this, guess I did'n't. Small nelth timer tweak. sadly the remaining timer issues can't be fixed (initial p3 ones) cause that issue is actually a bug with way blizzard coded the transition.  
- bump alpha revisions
