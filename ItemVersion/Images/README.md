Image assets for ItemVersion

## `Icon.tga`

The icon for addon that shows up in the "AddOn List" at the character select screen.

This icon is a 128x128 cropping of the in-game cursor named
`interface/cursor/uiinteractcursor2x.blp`. The cropping is necessary because that
image is actually a composite of several sizes of the same icon, and we just want
the highest resolution one.

For ease, this icon may be found at
