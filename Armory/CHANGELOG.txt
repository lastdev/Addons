To find something enter "/ar find all | item | quest | spell | skill [namepart]", where you should choose one of search types "all", "item", "quest" "spell" or "skill", e.g. "/ar find item boots". If you omit the search type "all" will be assumed, .e.g. "/ar find all boots" is the same as "/ar find boots", but to search all occurrences of the phrase "spell" you need to specify "/ar find all spell".
# You can also search for multiple name parts, e.g. "/ar find boots for" will find "Boots of Foretelling" and "Reinforced Mail Boots". To search an extact phrase you need to put quotes (single or double) around it, e.g. "/ar find 'boots of for'".
