@cont1nuity:
- Adjustments of view distance values for TBC.
- Switching Aura Tooltip implementation from 'NameplateTooltip' to 'PlaterNamePlateAuraTooltip'.
- Adding fonts 'Oswald' and 'NuevaStd' as ttf fonts again.
- Exporting profile name for importing purposes.
- Increase profile import performance and show profile information instead of import string.
- Fixing a few global variable leaks.
- Disabling OTF fonts 'Oswald' and 'NuevaStd' as those are not working in 9.1.5, 2.5.2 and 1.14.0 (possibly not temporarily).
