## Changed in v2022.21

* Updated for 10.0.0 (but no data for Dragonflight rares is included yet)
* Merged my classic and retail versions together... changing my version-number scheme because I can't base it off the TOC any more
* Separate data-addons are no longer being used; you should delete them if your addon manager doesn't clean them up for you
* Missing Wrath loot was added, and routes added to many Wrath rares
* Various Pandaria locations were improved
* A few bugs around waypoint-setting were fixed
* Loot popups will no longer show a hint implying they can be clicked to target anything
