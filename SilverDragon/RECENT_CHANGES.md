## Changed in v2022.29

* Update Dragonflight rares
* Add Who's A Good Bakar? to tooltips
* Improve how the popup's loot button count behaves when only showing items relevant to your character; it'll now notice when item data isn't loaded from the server completely and refresh the count once it's available
* Fix display of the Battle For Azeroth Black Empire Assault rares, which I had tied to the continent-level icons that Blizzard removed when Dragonflight launched
