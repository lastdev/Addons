## Changed in v90100.8

* Improve sending locations to chat:
    * If there's a vignette available it'll be used for the most-reliable location, and vignettes being seen *after* a chat announcement will update the target popup
    * Show the associated location in the tooltip for the target popup
* Improve the minimap:
    * Show mob routes (if present) on the minimap
    * Fix minimap icon alpha settings not being applied
    * Make minimap icon motion smoother
* Burning Crusade: add a few mob patrol routes
* Vignette range extender: let clicks pass through the icons onto the minimap
* Ardenweald: Show the Ardenweald's a Stage achievement in tooltips
* Add a few sounds to the default set I register with LibSharedMedia
* If loot is restricted (covenant, class), still show it as known if you've got it
