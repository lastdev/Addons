## Changed in v2022.31

* Differentiate treasure vignettes on GUID rather than ID -- this is going to make things like the Expedition Scout's Pack or Disturbed Dirt pop up alerts more frequently, since every separate copy of them is going to alert
* A bunch of data improvements
* Don't double-up on the LDB mob-tooltip
