## Changed in v90105.0

* Updated for 9.1.5: mostly this just means LibQTip was updated
* Stopped Korthia from having the Maw's short-range vignette detection rules applied
* Avoid an error about `facing` that could happen if the map was open before the player was fully in the world
* Add various covenant assault achievements to tooltips
