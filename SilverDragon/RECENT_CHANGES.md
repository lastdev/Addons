## Changed in v90001.3

* Improve shift-clicking the popup to add a chat link:
    * Don't require you to have an open chatbox before pasting it there; open the default chatbox if you have nothing else open
    * Include the health for the mob if we can work it out (if it's a target or its nameplate is visible)
    * For sources that don't include the location (chat yells), link to the player's current location
* Option to hide the target popup when the mob dies
* Option to hide the waypoint arrow when you manually close the popup
* Mobs that you've added to the "custom" section will now bypass most "should I announce this?" checks (e.g. you can ignore the entire Warlords source, and manually-add Rukhmar)
* Unchecking "Got the loot" in the outputs config will now only affect mobs for which we know any drops
* Some _very timely_ improvements on Argus
* Achievement tooltip in the broker tooltip will now show your criteria-completion
* Rukhmar's questid added
* The highlight on the "store" popup theme was covering up the loot icon
* The X on the target popup wasn't appearing when the mob died
* Fixed `/silverdragon add` with no parameter causing an error
* Some more Shadowlands questids
* Some missing pets / toys
* Sha of Anger has only had one spawn point since 7.2 (thanks frumpymoons)
