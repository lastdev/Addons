## Changed in v2024.10

* Clicking the line in the history window will now try to target the mob (so long as you're out-of-combat)
* The history window wouldn't fully disable itself until your UI reloaded (it would reappear when you saw a rare)
* Added some fallbacks for missing textures in Classic
* Fix a very-rare error with missing achievement names in popups
