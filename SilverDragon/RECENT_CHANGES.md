## Changed in v2022.25

* Major data improvements to Burning Crusade rares (because I also released [HandyNotes: Burning Crusade](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes-burning-crusade)...)
* Another fix for macro generation with 10.0.2's new /click requirements
* Fix for mob tooltips being prevented from fading away in Classic
* Minor data fixes for Warlords, including finally showing Warleader Tome's route
