## Changed in v90005.2

* Blizzard has fixed a few typos in mob names, so add some code that'll refresh the name-cache when you actually see one of these mobs
* Range extended minimap vignettes weren't showing tooltips
* Check parent zones for mobs with a given name, which should help when you hear a yell while in a subzone
* Fixed right-clicking the popup close button to ignore the mob
* Miscellaneous small data cleanups
