## Changed in v90200.11

* New announcement type: controller vibration, if you've enabled a controller via `/console GamePadEnable 1`
* Option in Outputs for whether to treat known-mounts as uninteresting; you might want to uncheck this if you're e.g. helping someone else hunt for a specific mount that you've already obtained
* Tweaks to what counts as "partially complete" for icons on the map, so non-achievement mobs with loot will be better represented
* When sending messages to chat, include a map pin hyperlink if available
* Add a missing mountid in Korthia
* Some earlier-expansion loot in Cataclysm, Pandaria, and Battle for Azeroth
