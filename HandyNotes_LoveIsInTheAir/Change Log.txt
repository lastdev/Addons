== v1.15 - 5th May 2025
* File of commonly used name spaced variables Added/updated
* Realm list updated
* Thematic colours for the AddOn are now it's own file
* Localised colours expanded upon
* Note: Huge list of NPCs etc that needs localising has STILL not been done. Plz don't
  remind as it will be done. Eventually
* Code changes directly copied to here from Children's Week AddOn
  Note: Will the AddOn be able to report INDIVIDUAL achievement progress? I can only
  find out during the event in 2026. For now, I'll carry on assuming this is true but
  it's an easy one line code switch (as per my CW AddOn) and is ready to go
* Above code changes add functionality for future data changes
* noContinent flag used throughout rather than a code hack in Core

  (Eg: Options for achievements will be correctly disabled in any new Vanilla/TBC version,
  Better handling of the Warbands/Shared achievement credit across characters, etc)
* The pin cluster is now on each continent rather than each major city. As explained
  elsewhere this is mainly due to pin crowding in cities
* Rarely encountered space line bug fixed
