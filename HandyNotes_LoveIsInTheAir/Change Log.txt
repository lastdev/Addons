* TOC update to 11.2.0

== v1.19 - 25th July 2025
* Dragons Tread Lightly now has increased accuracy for
  Classic Mists: What you will see will be a very small increase
  in precision on the continent maps and bigger improvement on
  the Azeroth map. DTL v1.03

== v1.18 - 20th July 2025
* Further modularisation of Lunar Festical
* Now partially overrides HN module Here Be Dragons
  due to incompatibility with Classic Mists. This AddOn
  now uses my Dragons Tread Lightly, which is a performance
  gain and enhancement anyway

  next season

* File of commonly used name spaced variables Added/updated
* Realm list updated
* Thematic colours for the AddOn are now it's own file
* Localised colours expanded upon
* Note: Huge list of NPCs etc that needs localising has STILL not been done. Plz don't
  remind as it will be done. Eventually
* Code changes directly copied to here from Children's Week AddOn
  Note: Will the AddOn be able to report INDIVIDUAL achievement progress? I can only
  find out during the event in 2026. For now, I'll carry on assuming this is true but
  it's an easy one line code switch (as per my CW AddOn) and is ready to go
* Above code changes add functionality for future data changes
* noContinent flag used throughout rather than a code hack in Core
* noAzeroth pin flag now supported in LIITA

  (Eg: Options for achievements will be correctly disabled in any new Vanilla/TBC version,
  Better handling of the Warbands/Shared achievement credit across characters, etc)
* The pin cluster is now on each continent rather than each major city. As explained
  elsewhere this is mainly due to pin crowding in cities
* Rarely encountered space line bug fixed
 
== v1.11 - 13th March 2025

* Daily givers for Horde and Alliance will now disappear off the map as per
  your options - this required special grouping code for the dailies
* Small easter egg I noticed for Alliance added to Gabbo quest text

== v1.07 - 13th February 2025
* This update focuses on the popup text being more helpful,
  especially for dailies
