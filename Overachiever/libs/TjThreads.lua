TjThreads.lua
  by Tuhljin

A library to manage coroutines, more easily letting addons use "threaded" tasks. It lets your addon accomplish time-intensive tasks
without disrupting gameplay or other scripts - provided the task function divides its work up into parts in an effective manner (using
coroutine.yield()).

Note that this library uses a frame with an OnUpdate handler. Although the frame is automatically hidden when there are no active threads,
it might be better (rather than using this library) to use one of the C_Timer functions, depending on what your function is doing. (A
Blizzard rep said C_Timer is generally more efficient than using OnUpdate but an exception is "when you have a ticker with a very short
period - something that's going to fire every couple frames.")

The library is quite simple. Future features might include things like balancing time spent between threads but that's overkill at the
moment. All it does now is, every other tick, run one task (but some tasks might be more intensive than others; we don't account for that
by running two smaller ones or any such thing).

ok = TjThreads.AddTask( func )
  Add a task to the list.
  Arguments:
    func (function)		The function to call. This is not a coroutine (the library creates and manages the coroutine for the function) but
                        should make proper use of coroutine.yield().
  Returns:
    ok (boolean)		True if the task was added. False if that function is already on the list.

ok = TjThreads.RemoveTask( func )
  Remove a task from the list.
  Arguments:
    func (function)		The function to call.
  Returns:
    ok (boolean)		True if the task was removed. False if that function wasn't on the list.

TjThreads.RushTask( func )
  Force a task to finish. The coroutine will be resumed repeatedly until the thread is dead (when the function is exited without using
  coroutine.yield()). Careful not to use this with a function that will not naturally end when called repeatedly in this manner! The task
  is automatically removed afterward.

Example usage:

  TjThreads.AddTask(
    function()
	  local yieldIn = 50 -- Change this to another number to adjust how much work is done each time the thread is resumed
	  for x,id in ipairs(list) do
	    yieldIn = yieldIn - 1
	    if (yieldIn < 1) then
	      coroutine.yield()
	      yieldIn = 50
	    end
	    -- Do main work here
	  end
    end
  )
