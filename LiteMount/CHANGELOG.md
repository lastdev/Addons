# LiteMount

## [10.0.7](https://github.com/xod-wow/LiteMount/tree/10.0.7) (2022-11-17)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/xod-wow/LiteMount/compare/10.0.6...10.0.7) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/xod-wow/LiteMount/releases)

- Update ToC for 10.0.2  
- Fix creating profile from current settings.  
    Fixes #116  
- Add Guardian Vorquin family  
- Remove help for no longer existing slash commands  
- Remove /litemount mount and /litemount smartmount  
    They are too confusing. The fact that because of Blizzard they can never do  
    anything except summon journal mounts will never be obvious enough for them  
    to be a good idea. It is better for people to learn to use and live with the  
    binding or /click activations, as that is what Blizzard have limited to  
    being able to work.  
    This is probably going to make some people unhappy, but it can't be helped.  
    I'm sure people think I spend all my time making it choose mounts or make  
    groups or randomly summon things. Sadly, literally 90% of the time is spent  
    making it just do anything at all, when everything it does is something  
    Blizzard spend a lot of effort trying to stop, in case you used it to cheat.  
    For people who just want journal mounts from a slash command there are  
    simpler and easier addons that don't do or try to do more.  
- Live-update the summon counts in the mounts UI
