# LiteMount

## [10.1.0-4](https://github.com/xod-wow/LiteMount/tree/10.1.0-4) (2023-05-25)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/xod-wow/LiteMount/compare/10.1.0-3...10.1.0-4) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/xod-wow/LiteMount/releases)

- Restore original summon style for non-tarecgosa. Heckin blizzard stop  
    C\_MountJournal.SummonByID in some druid forms (but not others) even though using  
    /cast works. Attempt to handle Tarecgosa as a special case with /cancelform added  
    for druids in cat, bear or treant form.  
    Curse you Blizzard, half-assing druid form support since 2004. :)
