- prep a new tag to fix blizzard dumb dumb, and i hate that I have to do this but also have no choice but to make it a forced update.  
- Why blizzard. Fix a whole slew of broken things caused by blizzard deciding to append realm name on all combat log events for players on same realm.  
- remove hacky classic infoframes because blizzard refused to support boss unit Ids in classic. it's an inefficient messy hack that's trying to fix a problem that's not worth fixing in DBM if it's not worth supporting by blizzard  
- - fixing nameplate icons test mode (#311)  
- Fix double cooldowns on nameplate icons (#310)  
- bump alpha
