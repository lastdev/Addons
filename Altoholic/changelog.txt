Altoholic Changelog 
===================

The up-to-date changelog can now be found at: https://github.com/teelolws/Altoholic-Retail/commits/master

IMPORTANT NOTE: As with every new expansion, many things have changed in the API, and it is REQUIRED to clear your Saved Variables for the addon.
This means cleaning the following files in \WTF\Account\<your_account>\SavedVariables : Altoholic.lua & All DataStore*.lua

There WILL be bugs if you use your old files without cleaning them first. 
Some fixes to work around API changes are too time consuming, so cleaning is required. A meagre price to pay once per expansion.
