## Changed in v34

* Updated for 10.2.0
* Handler updates:
  * Routes can appear on the minimap
  * Avoid some possible tooltip errors with other addons
  * Minimap routes should respect display settings
  * New config "only show notable NPCs": enable and rares will only be shown if they've got something for you (achievements or transmogs)
