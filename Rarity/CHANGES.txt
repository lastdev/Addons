commit 1cecc204f400cb0163c70b046268be21e8f4ec8f
Author: Sacred Duckwhale <duckwhale@mail.ru>

    Enabled tracking for ALL the gathering spell IDs
    
    I really have no idea which ones are actually used ingame, and I wasn't
    able to find out how exactly 8.0.1 has changed the profession skills now
    that they're split up by expansion.
    
    Therefore, I'm adding them all and hope that will be enough for at least
    the remainder of BFA.

commit 0183012a77311cdd4302b08a06d87450f93afb0e

    Added filter system for the NPC tooltips
    
    This will allow filtering of the extended tooltip info added to NPC
    tooltips. It is based on predefined filter types, such as profession,
    class, level, or defeated status (NYI).
    
    Only the IS_SPELL_KNOWN type is currently supported, but the system will
    likely be extended. Some more generalization is needed. It shall be
    added in the future (when new filters are required).

Author: Sacred Duckwhale <duckwhale@mail.ru>
Date:   Wed Aug 8 10:26:34 2018 +0200

    Fixed zone detection for Fossorial Bile Larva
    
    Clearly an oversight. It was counting ALL loot events, anywhere on
    Argus, instead of Skinning-based events only

    Added tooltip for all skinnable beasts on Argus
    
    For the Fossorial Bile Larva pet, obviously. Still need to add a filter
    to avoid showing it if Skinning is not learned, as this will show the
    item for ALL professions.

    Too many locals... and a typo for Antoran Wastes to boot!
