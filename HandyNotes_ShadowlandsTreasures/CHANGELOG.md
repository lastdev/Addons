## Changed in v20

* Add the inquisitors for It's Always Sinny In Revendreth

## Changed in v19

    * Wardrobe Makeover
* Properly explain acquiring Sorrowbane
* Show when loot is covenant-specific
* Fix Dead Blanchy's position, show where you are in the questline in its note
* Change how the tooltip anchors, so it's less likely to be in the way; there's an option for the old behavior if you prefer it

## Changed in v15

* Many Ardenweald improvements, but mostly to the Night Mare questline

## Changed in v14

* Routes on the map will highlight when you mouse over the relevant point
* The Maw now has a marker for the Waystone
* Bastion achievement What is that Melody? now included
* Various Bastion cleanups and some notes on Anima Shard locations
* Revendreth: explain the Forgotten Angler's Rod, since you may have to re-phase for it

## Changed in v13

* Can now show paths on the map; use this for the carriage routes in Revendreth and to link the teleporters in the Maw
* Some treasures don't count as "done" until you've used an item collected from them or completed a quest they start. These will now be hidden while you're carrying that item / are on that quest
    * I probably haven't flagged all of these ones yet
* Updates to Ardenweald's initial leveling portion
* Small updates to Maldraxxus
* Small updates to Revendreth
* Maw now has some lore nodes

## Changed in v12

* Add config to let achievement status override quest status. Enabling this will stop the daily rares from showing after you've killed them once.
* Add config to let account-knowable loot (mounts, toys, pets) which is known count as "found". This is enabled by default.

## Changed in v11

* Add a toggle so you can turn that world map button off if you don't want it
* Tweaked the default icon scale to be slightly smaller
* Improved Ardenweald, mostly so that icons for sub-objectives are easier to pick out from the main treasures
* More Maw loot has shown up

## Changed in v10

* Add a button to the world map for easy config access

## Changed in v9

* Better display for quests in tooltips
* Updated loot and notes for all zones

## Changed in v8

* Improved the data for Bastion and Maldraxxus
* Better display when treasures aren't currently available, though data is very incomplete as to which ones do (because it's difficult to tell without visiting them all... and it might turn out to *really* be "are you in any covenant?" and I need 
to get a leveling character to the right point to test this)
    * By default unavailable mobs/treasures will still show up, but tinted red. If this is very annoying, there's a setting for it in the options

## Changed in v7

* Add Chaotic Riftstones to the Maw
* Fix check that was stopping collected jellycats from being hidden before you'd completed the entire Nine Afterlives achievement

## Changed in v6

* Add achievement: Nine Afterlives (the jellycats)
* Flag Bastion Abandoned Stockpile as being max-level, and highlight its entrance.
* Fix the Larion Tamer's Harness location and loot
* Explain the Corrupted Clawguard better
* Make path-to-treasure nodes display on the minimap automatically
* Cache loot when opening the zone map, so there's less "loading..."
* Change the default point icon to the blizzard default chest vignette icon (which looks way better than it did in the last expansion)
* Add some config for setting a default icon, if you'd prefer something different

## Changed in v5

* Update loot and some spawn locations

## Changed in v4

* Fix an error in the Maw if you were using item icons

* Filled out questids for per-character completion
* A lot more information about Blanchy
* The Shard Labor achievement in Bastion

## Changed in v1

* Created with the achievement-related treasures
