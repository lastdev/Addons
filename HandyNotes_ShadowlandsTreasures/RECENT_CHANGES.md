## Changed in v74

* Updated for 10.2.0
* Fix from Machou for the questid associated with Schematic: Mawdapted Raptora in Zereth Mortis
* Handler updates:
    * Avoid some possible tooltip errors with other addons
    * Minimap routes should respect display settings
    * New config "only show notable NPCs": enable and rares will only be shown if they've got something for you (achievements or transmogs)
