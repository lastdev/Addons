## Changed in v31

* Korthia: include Invasive Mawshrooms and Nests of Unusual Materials
* Maldraxxus: say whether the arena mount has been attempted today
* Listen to the CRITERIA_UPDATE event again, as it seems to no longer be spammed constantly, which should make things like the Spectral Key get removed from your minimap more promptly
