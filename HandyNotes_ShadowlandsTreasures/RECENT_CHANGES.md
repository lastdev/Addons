## Changed in v30

* Maw Kyrian Assault: added the Sinfall Screecher pet
* A Sly Fox will now show on the minimap as well as the world map
* Xyraxz and Yarxhov will be labeled as such, rather than as the relics they're guarding
* Observer Yorik's quest id has been updated
* A new Maelie location has been added
* Maelie's progress will show better when you're at 6/6 and haven't turned in the quest to get the mount yet
* Removed the Glimmerfly Cocoon toy finally, it's definitely not dropping
