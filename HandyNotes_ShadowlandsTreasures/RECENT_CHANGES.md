## Changed in v42

* A hotfix on March 1st put the Ancient Translocators on the Zereth Mortis map (*so* on the map that they're the only thing you can see if you've got no map-completion at all üòÅ), so I'm removing mine
* Added some notes to schematic loot drops indicating whether they're for a mount or a pet
* Remove an item from Hirukon that was incorrectly flagged as being a pet -- it's just an ingredient for a pet
* Prep-work for adding points for schematic-gathering, all hidden for now
