## Changed in v63

* Added Explorer achievements, via a map icon that shows a spot that'll definitely get you the map completion for the achievement
* Improved paths to some points in several maps
* Zereth Mortis: some schematics were shown as available too soon (before you'd unlocked protoform synthesis)
* Group names in tooltips could sometimes be improperly formatted
