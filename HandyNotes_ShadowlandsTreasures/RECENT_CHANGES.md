## Changed in v64

* Various quality of life improvements for points related to other points (hovering them will show a link to the related point)
* Show Apocopocolypse Now progress on coreless automa in Zereth Mortis
* Show Synthe-supersized! progress on the protoform points
* Add a missing vignette ID to the Protector of the First Ones
* A typo was stopping mount-completion from being shown on the Fallen Charger
* Stop always-showing the Sinrunners and Carriages in Revendreth; since flying has been available that's much less useful
