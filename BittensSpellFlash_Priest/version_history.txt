== Version 50400.1.2
* Bugfix update to Bitten's SpellFlash Library.

== Version 50400.1.1

* All: Now flashes food buffs.
* All: Now flashes Dispel Magic.

== Version 3.0.3
Update for patch 5.3.

* Shadow: Improved prediction/detection of whether the cooldown of Shadow Word: Death will trigger.

== Version 2.9.0-beta
* Shadow: Flashing should be smoother, with better indications when to interrupt channeling.  E.g. Mind Blast will start flashing small and green as soon as you start a Mind Flay channel, if it will be the next spell, then switch to normal flashing once the cooldown is up.
* Shadow: Tweaked rotation for a slight dps gain (according to simulations).
* Shadow: Added flashing for Silence.
* Shadow: Added flashing for Vampiric Embrace.
* Shadow: Bugfix - Devouring Plague ticks every second, not every 3.
