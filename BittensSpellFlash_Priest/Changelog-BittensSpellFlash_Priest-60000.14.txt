Implement basic WoD 100 Shadow rotation.

No Void Entropy, no Clarity of Power, just the most basic rotation
possible, implemented and tested at 100.  Not that most people will ever
use this, but whatever, it is a good start.

Handle Glyph of Mind Harvest orb prediction.

The first time we hit a new target with this glyph, we generate three
orbs; this fixes the prediction so we know when that is going to happen,
and account for it correctly.

That should result in, eg, correctly flashing Devouring Plague on the
first cast from empty, when before we assumed only one orb was
generated...

Correctly handle enhanced shadow orbs, and enhance SW:D for
shadow priests.

We previously had a few places that used three orbs when calculating the
maximum, which led to less orb generation than it should.  We also kept
the "CD reset prevents orb generation" even if you had the perk that
removed that restriction.

Overall effect should be much better management of orb generation, which
should fix the DPS deficit that lack of support was causing.

Enable Power Word: Shield for Shadow

This is used defensively, and is the only non-intrusive defensive we
have, so is pretty important.  It flashes yellow above 50 percent, and
red below that, but is optional in both cases so that it doesn't break
the rotation.

The theory is that especially in a raid of dungeon situation, until you
are really hurt, you probably don't want to give up DPS in return for
health most of the time, but below the 50 percent line, your healers
might start to worry ... and in the world of triage, a DPS rates well
below the tanks and healers, so you should probably look after yourself
for a bit.

Update Shadow rotation to work at ~ 91

This isn't a complete shadow rework, and the 100 talents radically
change rotations, so they definitely need love, but we now have the most
basic rotation down at lower levels.
