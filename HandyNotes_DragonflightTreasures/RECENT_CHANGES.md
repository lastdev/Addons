## Changed in v32

* Add the various chests for Sacred Tuskarr Totems in Azure Span, hidden by default
* Explain what to do with the gleamfish for Shellkhan a bit better
* Fix the requirement for Lizi's Reins day 4, thanks to stevietv!
* Fix the "debug mode" being on in cases when it shouldn't be, which would have made you see a largely pointless "coord" line in the map tooltips
* More rare data, disturbed dirt, packs, etc
