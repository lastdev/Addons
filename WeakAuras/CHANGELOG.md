# [5.17.5](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/tree/5.17.5) (2024-11-06)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/compare/5.17.4...5.17.5)

## Highlights

- cataclysm classic: fixed spec load option dropdown ordering
- custom code: aura_env.saved no longer wipes on update if user accepts "display" category
  - ðŸš¨ note - since most people don't fiddle with the defaults when updating auras, this effectively meant that aura_env.saved was always wiped on update.
    It's possible that some authors of custom code have come to rely on this to not have to fixup old saved data with custom code updates, please fix your code if so!
- other minor fixes
