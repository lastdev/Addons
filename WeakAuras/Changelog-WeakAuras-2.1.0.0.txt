--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- Update TOC for Patch 6.1
Tzarc:
	- Added table "aura_env" for all custom functions of an aura.
	An aura-specific table, "aura_env", has been added for use for all
	custom functions of an aura.
	Additionally, an "On Init" section has been added to the Actions
	tab, which provides another custom function and is guaranteed to be
	executed before any other custom function defined for that aura.
Infus:
	- Import: Disable import button while in combat
	Since Warlords of Draenor WoW simply interrupts addons that take
	to long while in combat. Since especially importing takes quite
	long, WoW can interrupt us in the middle of importing. That then
	might leave our internal data in a inconsistent state.
	
	I could reproduce the issues reported in ticket number 183 after
	3 tries in trying to import in combat.
	
	So on entering combat we disable the import button.
	
	Ticket-number: 183
	- Make specific unit work for combat log event triggers
	The text entry for specific unit has a derived its hidden function
	incorrectly from the parent's hidden function.
	
	The two changes:
	a) Pass in the trigger to the hidden function
	b) If hidden was a function the "or hidden" part would always be
	   true, since a function is a true value.
	
	Making those options visible seem to be enough to actually fix
	the ticket 247.
	- Aurabar: Add color option for icon
	Allows for separately making the icon transparent, since every
	other part has a color setting, this kind of makes sense.
	
	Ticket-number: 245
	- Import tooltip: Truncate on more than 30 auras
	Ticket-number: 182
	- Rewrite Ignore Rune CD
	Apparently a spell cd due to a rune has always a duration of 10.
	So, rewrite the ignore rune cd option to use that fact. And track
	the spell cooldowns but disregard any update that has a duration of
	10 for those spells.
	- Fix remaining time check for some auras
	Ticket-number: 68
	- Fix sorting in dynamic groups
	We need to set the duration information in the region before we
	call expand, as expand will call controlChildren, which sorts
	according to the duration info.
	
	Ticket-number: 156
Steffen Buehl:
	- change dungeon difficulty load condition from select to multiselect
