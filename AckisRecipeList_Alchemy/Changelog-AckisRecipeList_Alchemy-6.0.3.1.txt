--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Allocate acquire_data and (if applicable) faction/reputation level tables for all recipes when requested by the ARL core.
	- Allocate item_list tables for all AcquireType entities; this is now required by ARL.
	- Variable name changes.
	- Updated all AcquireType:AddEntity() calls to match changes in ARL core.
	- Added a Recipes table to the module, and reworked AddRecipe() - now creates a populated recipe table which is then passed to the core's AddRecipe method, along with the module itself.
	- Attached the FOLDER_NAME as module.Name. Changed module.version to module.Version
	- Added module version checking; don't load anything if there isn't a match.
	- Moved ITEM_FILTER_TYPES definition to Filters.lua, where it should have been to begin with.
