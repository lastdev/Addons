- Some minor timer tweaks, but ultimately it's still hard to fix legacy timers with such short boss fight times. It may ultimately stay incomplete until Season 2 at this rate, and it's perfectly fine since it's such an undertuned instance.  
- Further updates to Halls of Infusion updating Watcher and Tsunami some more  
- slight timer tweak to last  
- Several bugfixes and timer updates to Halls of Infusion  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#73)
