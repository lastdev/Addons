- and another tweak  
- tweak  
- fixed bug where fissure count never actually incremented on vexamus  
- hotfixes were incorrect. it was actually nerfed even harder than they stated  
- Meant to push this before bed but forgot. Updated post hotfix timers for azureblade  
-  - Made trash alerts that are extremely important to crowd control in high keys use the "crowd control" voice line, even when they aren't special announcements. These spells include Rally the Clan, Desecrating Roar, Flame Dance, and Tectonic Slam. Issue #108  
     - Added dispel alert to Brilliant Scales. Surprised it wasn't there already. If blizzard things it's noteworthy enough to nerf, it's probably noteworthy enougn to announce.  
- fix bug where sanctify timer got extended before it even started on trash  
- adjust arcane bash alert  
- fix same error in another mod  
- fix copy paste error  
- Work to unify wrath dungeons  
- Adjustments to vexamus to always show mana bomb targets (no filter option)  
    Adjustments to vexamus to say "aoe incoming" for begining of arcane fissure cast instead of 'watch step". "watch step" will now be said when cast finishes. two diff mechanics to same spell that need more clarity.  
    Also added count to fissure alert  
- more tweaks to profession levels  
- tweak profession levels  
- Update koKR (#111)  
- Revert "small tweak to use guid scan method  on nerzhul instead of cid, which is slightly more efficient"  
- small tweak to use guid scan method  on nerzhul instead of cid, which is slightly more efficient
