- Fix last  
- lastly,, downgrade end warning to non special announce, doesn't need to be accessive for a positive announce  
- also extend canceling to all 3 boss Ids in off chance skulloc isn't boss1  
- re-enable gron smash timer, since people complain about it enough. Just hope they don't complain it's wrong 1/4th of time (which is why it was disabled)  
- missed a line  
- Intangible presence is now even less tangible  
- While I intended to avoid something that was clearly not intended, I can't let DBM users feel disadvantaged over people other mods/WAs for this....so  
    Added the hacky detection of intangible presence detection to Huntsman.  
- Finish Nokhud drycode  
- Raging Tempest mod  
- Update boss arrangements and fix one boss journal Id  
- fix bad copy/paste  
- Granyth drycode
