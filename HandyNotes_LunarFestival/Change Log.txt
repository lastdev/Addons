== v4.27 - 26th September 2025
* TOC update to 5.5.1

== v4.26 - 3rd August 2025
* TOC update to 11.2.0

== v4.25 - 29th July 2025
* Dragons Tread Lightly now has increased accuracy for
  Classic Mists: What you will see will be a very small increase
  in precision on the continent maps and bigger improvement on
  the Azeroth map. DTL v1.03

== v4.24 - 24th July 2025
* Ensure that DB is correctly saved across AddOns
* Missing colour table entry for a quest type

== v4.23 - 17th July 2025
* Further modularisation of Lunar Festival
* Now partially overrides HN module Here Be Dragons
  due to incompatibility with Classic Mists. This AddOn
  now uses my Dragons Tread Lightly, which is a performance
  gain and enhancement anyway
* Various pin movements/changes to accomodate Classic Mists
  Note to self: Dungeon / special instanced zones were getting
  rippled up to Azeroth ( and the Situation in Dalaran to EK!).
  Could prevent this in a DTL table in the future

== v4.22 - 18th June 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.7
* Classic Mists 5.5.0 added!

== v4.21 - 5th May 2025

== v4.20 - 8th April 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.5

== v4.19 - 8th April 2025
* Duplicate colour in the pin cluster! Doh!
* Small change to one pin's positioning in the pin cluster
* Switched load order of Data and Core
* Renamed setHistory to setFlavour because I wanted to lol
* Rarely encountered space line bug fixed
* Potential missing Achievement criteria in the pin cluster resolved

== v4.18 - 29th March 2025
* Colours in their own file
* Map ID numbers use a standardised format which works across all game versions
* Various other changes to align code with the latest code base from my Noblegarden AddOn
* The Pin clusters in cities / sometimes continents / Azeroth are now solely continents.
  Why the change: Planning ahead. There will be a cluster for every one of my event AddOns.
  Each AddOn will have a fixed (ie familiar) location for its pin cluster. They will not
  overlap. Too many difficulties shunting around on the city map and Azeroth map as those
  maps are way too crowded with quest markers and such
  
== v4.17 - 13th March 2025
* Better layout based upon LIITA World Event AddOn

   (i.e. the current season) and no longer achievement index (ie. ever for the character)
* Large Dragon Isles zone pin on Azeroth repositioned as it conflicts with one of my other AddOns
* Improved formatting. Gone are the seemingly doubled/repeated achievement descriptions

* Added The Maelstrom Elder pins to Azeroth map
* Better positioning of Classic Cataclysm's Cataclysm zone meta pin

== v4.11 - 4th February 2025

== v3.04 - 7th January 2025
* Added another HandyNotes Refresh() delay for logins (both new and character swap),
  reloads, and loading screen situations (various - enter/exit instances or Mage
  teleport, etc). This will assist players with slow internet, unusual Blizzard
  server glitches, too many AddOns, potato PCs
  Note: This is a preemptive change due to a report for another of my AddOns
* Lunar Preservation buff counting overhauled

== v3.03 - 24th December 2024

  I arbitrarily set the timer to checking every 3 seconds - to avoid FPS / DPS hits
  If show/hide via the options panel then that's instant
  If in combat then I rely wholly on the HandyNotes engine to avoid taint errors
  (a main reason I moved to the HN ecosystem years ago)
