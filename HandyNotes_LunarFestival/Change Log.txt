* Added another HandyNotes Refresh() delay for logins (both new and character swap),
  reloads, and loading screen situations (various - enter/exit instances or Mage
  teleport, etc). This will assist players with slow internet, unusual Blizzard
  server glitches, too many AddOns, potato PCs
  Note: This is a preemptive change due to a report for another of my AddOns
* Lunar Preservation buff counting overhauled

== v3.03 - 24th December 2024

  I arbitrarily set the timer to checking every 3 seconds - to avoid FPS / DPS hits

  If in combat then I rely wholly on the HandyNotes engine to avoid taint errors
  (a main reason I moved to the HN ecosystem years ago)
