* Update for the new version of Bitten's SpellFlash Library.

== Version 50400.1.0

* All: Now flashes Tranquilizing Shot.
* All: Now flashes food buffs.

NOTE: This version includes a new version of Bitten's SpellFlash Library that I tried to test well, but if you find any issues please let me know right away.

== Version 2.5.2
* Making the "Out of Date" status go away.  Please report any real issues w/ the new patch.

* All: Now dumps focus if Fervor is coming off cooldown.
* All: Better tracking of Thrill of the Hunt.

== Version 2.3.1

* Now flashes the Call Pet flyout when you don't have a pet out.

== Version 2.3.0
* Added a Beast Mastery rotation for the MoP beta.

== Version 2.2.0
* All: Added AoE rotations.  See your keybindings to activate them.

== Version 2.1.0
* Beast Mastery / Survival: Changed the threshold for Arcane Shot to 64% (sims showed an improvement for survival, and that leaves BM almost unchanged if you have 2/2 Kindred Spirits).
