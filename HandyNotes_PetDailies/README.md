HandyNotes - Pet Dailies
========================


What it does
------------

This addon displays locations of incomplete pet tamer dailies on the worldmap and minimap.  All pet battles are available but battles that reward coins are turned off by default.  Additionally, battles needed to complete the Awfully Big Adventure can be shown.
If you also have TomTom or Cartographer installed, you can right-click on a marker to create a Waypoint arrow.

Requires [HandyNotes](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes) to work.
