== v5.13 - 4th November 2025
* The Exobar text added for The Exodar pin
* Fire Brigade Practice is a One Time quest, not Seasonal
* Visibility of the "hag" quest in Legion Dalaran / Val'sharah
* Zidormi message is now simpler and much clearer
* Commenced the 2026 simplification to remove the visual overload
  in the Candy Buckets (and more) tooltips. This is a tedious,
  manual process that will occur in bits and bobs over time

== v5.12 - 1st November 2025
* Arathi had a missing zidormi flag
* Tidied up other zidormi based pins
* Improved the zidormi buff checking - I now check for every known buff,
  not just those enocntered in testing
* Clarified the quest/achievement popup text
* Defaults to all the quests/achievements set to ticked
* Bouldercrag typo prevented seeing
* Eastwind... slide it to the right

== v5.11 - 1st November 2025
* Garrison improvements. Pins appearing but...
  (Might have a second go at this. Depends upon feedback.
  Whilst pedantically correct pin placement, they are on top
  of each other. Might be better to space them, even if
  technically not location perfect)

== v5.10 - 29th October 2025
* Correction to an Italian translation - copy paste error -
  for "Other Candy Buckets"
* Added translations for "Don't Show" except for the French
  (See Tulsow below)
* Added translations for the new Candy and Spider textures

== v5.09 - 27th October 2025
* Two new textures: Hallow's End Spider & Hallow's End Candy.
  (Up to now the socalled Candy texture is actually a texture
  borrowed from another event. The reason being that it had
  better colour contrast when it appears on the typical in
  game map which is predominantly shades of burnt yellow. The
  garish red and white candy stripes work well. Mentioned
  here in case people think I mistakenly used the Children's
  Week candy texture!)
  
== v5.08 - 24th October 2025
* Grom'gol correction. Thanks @Taizun!

== v5.07 - 23rd October 2025
* French translations from @Tulsow @ Curseforge

== v5.06 - 22nd October 2025
* Dragon Isles review. Very minor coord tweaks here and there.
* Added neighbouring pins to zones so as to assist flying decisions.
  (No AddOn / Blizzard themselves provide the means to automatically
  populate a zone with near neighbour pins of other zones. It is a
  manual process. Likewise pins from extra zones like Mechagon and
  Zaralek on Continents - but I've already implemented automation
  for a select few)
* Found a typo for a pin. Forget which one lol.
* Dragon Isles bug remains: Problem with pins (perhaps due to racing)
  not getting populated automatically on a continent map. Mainly The
  Waking Shores. I suspect Blizzard have some hidden textures,
  especially chequered flags, that are at a higher level than Handy-
  Notes uses. This will resolve itself in 2026 once I have fully 
  abandoned HandyNotes. For now though, sad times.

== v5.05 - 21st October 2025
* All Khaz Algar pins coords checked from 2024. Tweaks here and there.
* Added neighbouring zone pins for all Khaz Algar.
* Adjusted visibility for AK/CoT/Lower CoT.
* Khaz Algar pins now appear on the continent. Not possible 2024 due
  to HandyNotes limitations which have been replaced for 2025 with
  my own module.
* Hallowed Be Thy Name and a couple of others flagged as definitely
  account only with no known hacks to glean per character data.
  This flag affects if "completed by [name]" appears at the top of
  a tooltip and sometimes on the criteria lines too.
  Please understand that the available data is inconsistent and depends
  on a LOT of factors. It's not as easy as you might imagine.

== v5.04 - 20th October 2025
* The Ringing Deeps now much better positioned

== v5.03 - 20th October 2025
* Alliance indexing problem for Eastern Kingdoms in Classic Mists
* Honeydew Village marked as Alliance. Now Horde
* Right side changed to left side on a tooltip
* Improvements to the way all achievements handled for Classic Mists
* Neighbouring zone pins added in Dragon Isles to assist navigation

== v5.02 - 19th October 2025
* Had to resolve a situation whereby very full pins, typically in
  the pin cluster on each continent, had popup text overflowing off
  the bottom of the screen for low resolution video such as 720p,
  1080p, etc. This was even more of a problem in Classic.
  Resolved by now allowing a variable number of pins in a game
  version plus juggling of the contents of said pins.
* Pin clustering placement automation. Internal - AddOn user will
  see nothing.
  
== v5.01 - 16th October 2025
* Continent pins and Azeroth pins positions adjusted for
  all game versions, some also added if not yet implemented
  for all game versions.
* Classic Mists required juggling of achievement summaries
  (continent pin clusters) due to Blizzard's larger font sizing
  
== v5.00 - 11th October 2025
* Revamp for 2025. Now uses v2.02 of the Engine

== v4.08 - 3rd October 2025
* TOC update to 11.2.0

== v4.07 - 26th September 2025
* TOC update to 5.5.1

== v4.06 - 2nd August 2025
* TOC update to 11.2.0

== v4.05 - 20th July 2025
* Options to remove one time / daily quests after completion
* Option to not show pins on the Azeroth map (it can get rather crowded!)
* Further modularisation of Hallow's End
* Now partially overrides HN module Here Be Dragons
  due to incompatibility with Classic Mists. This AddOn
  now uses my Dragons Tread Lightly, which is a performance
  gain and enhancement anyway
* Various pin movements/changes to accomodate Classic Mists
* Dragons Tread Lightly now has increased accuracy for
  Classic Mists: What you will see will be a very small increase
  in precision on the continent maps and bigger improvement on
  the Azeroth map. DTL v1.03
* Azeroth map pins now correct for Classic Mists due to all of the above
* TOC update to 3.4.5
* TOC update to 11.1.7
* Khaz Algar continent pins are no longer visual guestimates for the zone
  pins: they really are rippled up to their parent continent from the zone
  due to using my DTL module

== v4.04 - 18th June 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.5
* TOC update to 3.4.4
* Classic Mists 5.5.0 added!

== v4.03 - 20th April 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.5

== v4.02 - 10th April 2025
* Pin cluster with every achievement covered. Added to every continent map
* Rarely encountered space line bug fixed
* Trivial code formatting change in popup Minimap menu
* Server/realm list updated

== v4.01 - 31st March 2025
* Further tweaks to options. Renaming, translating, added a mention about a console command, etc
* Further modularising of the code. Colours
* Removed some unnecessary localisations
* Adjusted a note/reminder about why I use one of two viable (at least in retail)
  means of obtaining a localised quest name
* Cosmetic change to highlighted text in the AddOn menu
* Stranglethorn Buckets shunted around a bit for Horde
* Dalaran and adjacent zones all coordinates adjusted for Classic Cataclysm AND Retail
  Over time Dalaran has shifted around slightly:
  Between Classic Cata and Dragonflight it has drifted a little to the South-east.
  Sometime after Dragonflight it has had a further, smaller shift to the south-east
  but with an additional small anti-clockwise rotation. This throws off all Dalaran coordinates
  with respect to other zones. Interestingly The Underbelly coordinates remain as is always.
  It didn't move but the open air surface above did move! Someone stuffed up at Blizzard lol.
  (Proof is in my October 2022 v1.05 release: I don't imagine those coordinates or pluck em out of the air
  or copy paste off dodgy website data. I literally stand on top of the Candy Bucket myself!)
* All Northrend data slightly changed for Classic Cataclysm to reflect versioning

== v4.00 - 24th March 2025
* Complete coding makeover
* Better Tooltip design
* New colour scheme
* Better map phase detection/messages
* Locations tweaked for various pins. Eg: Azure Watch
* Works around the erroneous data returned by GetAchievementCriteriaInfo
* Lots of small errors found adn corrected. Eg: Darkbreak Cove misplaced in Vashj'ir
* Removed most advertising for my other AddOns. A couple remain
* Removed the hack to force pins to propagate upwards as the problem is now resolved
* Every Guide and Tip were reviewed and improved

== v3.22 - 27th February 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.0

== v3.21 - 20th February 2025
* TOC update to 4.4.2

== v3.20 - 2nd February 2025
* Better Refresh delay to prevent that annoying GetAchievementCriteriaInfo abend

== v3.19 - 13th January 2025
* Added another HandyNotes Refresh() delay for logins (both new and character swap),
  reloads, and loading screen situations (various - enter/exit instances or Mage
  teleport, etc). This will assist players with slow internet, unusual Blizzard
  server glitches, too many AddOns, potato PCs
  Note: This is a preemptive change due to one report for another of my AddOns
	
== v3.18 - 30th December 2024
* Alliance Theramore pins - bug fix
* Upvalue for GetTime added

== v3.17 - 20th December 2024
* An abend might occur for a GetAchievementCriteriaInfo() call during a load screen,
  resulting in a nonsense LUA error message. Simple solution: the Minimap refresh
  delay is extended from 3 to 7 seconds.
  Note: This is a preemptive change due to one report for another of my AddOns

== v3.16 - 10th December 2024
* TOC update to 11.0.7

== v3.15 - 26th November 2024
* Minimap pins now disappear/appear around the same time as they do on the World Map
  I arbitrarily set the timer to checking every 3 seconds - to avoid FPS / DPS hits
  If show/hide via the options panel then that's instant
  If in combat then I rely wholly on the HandyNotes engine to avoid taint errors
  (a main reason I moved to the HN ecosystem years ago)
* Maladath added to the OCE server list

== v3.14 - 12th November 2024
* TOC update to 4.4.1

== v3.13 - 7th November 2024
* Typo: Exobar changed to Exodar

* "Garrision dailies" heading translated as best as I could

== v3.12 - 5th November 2024
* A lot more translations added. Mostly but not exclusively Garrison

== v3.11 - 3rd November 2024
* Fix for Dragon Isles Summary

== v3.10 - 2nd November 2024
* Dragonmaw Port bug fix

== v3.09 - 1st November 2024

* Desolation Hold in Southern Barrens added to Dustwallow Marsh (H)

== v3.07 - 30th October 2024
* Fire Extinguishing practice added
* Now distinguishig between Daily, Seasonal and One Time Quests
* Bug fix: double achievement title in popup

== v3.06 - 29th October 2024
* Val'sharah daily added
* Dalaran text for ^ was tweaked slightly

== v3.05 - 28th October 2024
* Improved logic for Summary displays

== v3.04 - 27th October 2024
* Dragon Isles is now a Summary on the Azeroth map - less clutter!
* Pandaria too
* Suppress coordinates for summary pins
* Removed a whole lot of unnecessary Continent filling code ( collating all pins from zone children)
* Reworked the logic for deciding whether a pin will be shown or not

== v3.03 - 26th October 2024
* Remove stray Khaz Algar pin from Classic Cataclysm
* Move an Ironforge Commons pin in Classic Cataclysm

* Fix fatal crash bug as reported by f_lambda

== v2.16 - 19th October 2023
All changes are for DF

* Miniscule/fussy changes of a hundredth decimal place or two to several others.

== v2.10 - 28th June 2023
* Support 10.1.5

== v2.09 - 6th May 2023
* Now supports the new AddOn Compartment introduced in 10.1.0.
  Clicking the drop down for this AddOn takes you directly to the configuration panel!

== v2.08 - 3rd May 2023
* Added an icon to the TOC file - thus removing the annoying "?" from the AddOn list in game
* Removed unnecessary print to console code

== v2.07 - 24th April 2023

* Remove left over references to "Noble Garden" due to me doing cut and paste between AddOns, sigh
* Updated the TOC title and the AddOn description so that there will be nice popup text if mousing over the AddOn

== v2.01 - 31st October 2022
* The base HN tools don't really seem to allow for duplicate coordinates. This poses a problem for me as my data structure has duplicate coordinates - one for Alliance, one for Horde. One manifestation of the problem is missing continent markers for one faction. Zones too but that was fixed in v2.00. I've now overcome the continent problem. I still need to ensure there are no duplicates at the zone level though. I'll live with that.
* With the above work I now need not fear missing markers on the Azeroth map, as has happened although I doubt anyone noticed as there were so many anyway already lol.
* Stranglethorn Vale "sub-continent" has been added back in. It was dumb to have removed it.
* The Garrison mission for Hallow's End has been added. I've never seen it myself but apparently it's still in the game.
* A typo for Refuge Pointe.
* I removed localisation of most API calls to avoid taint.

== v2.00 - 30th October 2022
* You now have the option to
(1) remove a marker if your account has ever completed it
(2) remove a marker if your character has ever completed it
(3) remove a marker if completed this season
* Numerous changes to the data file - corections to quest ID, tweaking coordinates, tooltip help tweaking, new data format for dailies / non-achievement buckets.
* World map displays now complete - data fully passed up from zones and continents
* With the inclusion of the mysterious Stonetalon Mountains crate (not part of an achievement), Theramore, Boralus, Garrison seasonal and dailies, etc the AddOn has literally 100% of all the Candy Buckets

== v1.06 - 26th October 2022
* Added Old Theramore
* Updated the game version to 10.0.0
* Several other titivations of which I don't recall the details. Slight position movements mostly.

== v1.06 - 25th October 2022
* As usual, lot's of refinements.
* The marker for Boralus in map 1161 was missing. It's there now!

== v1.05 - 23rd October 2022
  (What the hell happened between this release and the previous one. Release notes are identical. WTH lol)
* So many changes.... the main ones:
* Added a 3rd icon for "Other" or "miscellany". Specifically those candy buckets which are not a part of any achievement.
* Help for Draenor and Broken Isles now included for those completionists.
* Some Northrend Horde were rough as based off memory (lol). I've now completed a sweep of all achievement continents for both factions.

== v1.04 - 23rd October 2022

== v1.03 - 21st October 2022
* Way to many tweaks and polishes to note. I'd say I'm pretty much done with Cataclysm, Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor for both factions for the time being.
* For example I made notes about how to easily access Deepholm and Vashj'ir. Added a bit of fun trivia.
* Almost every Azeroth location has had its coordinates adjusted a hundredth of a point or two because I'm like that lol.

== v1.02 - 20th October 2022
* Pandaria and Northrend have been polished
* Coordinate tweaking
* comments too

== v1.01 - 18th October 2022
* Vashj'ir help needed a bit of polish
* Likewise the Daily quests

== v1.00 - 18th October 2022
* Initial release. Wooo!
