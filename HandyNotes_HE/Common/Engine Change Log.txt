== v2.07 - 3rd November 2025
* Cleaned up change logging. One unified version numbering for all parts of TarEng.
* First appearance of the new mapping subsystem.
* First look at the new "No achievement tracking in zone popups" option.
* Data_xxx template.

== v2.06 - 1st November 2025
* Added extra zidormi buffs. The list is now very complete.
  Also added programming notes there too.
* Zidormi message is now a lot clearer.
* Events: Default is true (i.e. auto removal on completion) for pin types.
  Previously false for all options.

== v2.05 - 27th October 2025
* Added translations for "Don't Show", except French as already done by Tulsow.

== v2.04 - 23rd October 2025
* French translations from @Tulsow @ Curseforge.

* More rigorous checking of game version numbers in the main tooltip routine
  (or maybe the previous release. Forget)

== v2.03 - 18th October 2025
* Pin clustering automation added. Placed here so that non-event AddOns may use it too.
* Events: Parameter v.forceShowLine added
* Events: CompletionShow() can now show a line without a completion status

== v2.02 - 10th October 2025
* Versioning support. Can now abandon old defaults as necessary. This
  code will obviously change over time as necessary but the system is
  in place. Functions_Common.
* Individual pin scaling.
* Events: Removed copy pasted block that belonged in the ARH AddOn's own block

== v2.01 - 9th October 2025
* Improved logic for CompletionFormatAndShow and AddOnEventTooltipLines
* Bug with character headers not showing completion - Functions_Events
* Translated verbose Tooltip to explain that character based pin removal
  on achievement (criteria) being completed is difficult/impossible in
  WoW since 10.0.0+.
* Better use of ns.aoa table
  ^ All above due to struggles to provide a turn-key and ACCURATE system
  for reporting PER CHARACTER achievement completion in the retail era
  of Warbanding / shared achievements where the data just isn't available.
  ^ All of the above for the Events sub-module.
* New texture indexing system. More flexible, with the future in mind.
* A bug with the way this AddOn works with HandyNotes. It appears that a
  Refresh pins fires before the AddOn is fully loaded. Happened on one
  char only and was intermittent and only for a char load. Reload etc not
  a problem. Resolved by ensuring that all required ns. variables have
  been defined in the main body of each .lua file. ns.cluster = {} in
  Functions_Common found to be the culprit. Monitor.
  
== v2.00 - 8th October 2025
* Released with the PB AddOn. MMPT was very similar at the time.
* Events sub-module built upon that used in EAP and APLT and ARH at the time.

== Previous
* No versioning. Evolved with use in Event based AddOns and EAP AddOn.
* First v2 efforts in APLT and MMPT AddOns.
