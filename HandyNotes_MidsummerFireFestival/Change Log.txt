== v3.17 - 17th December 2025
* TOC update to 11.2.7

== v3.16 - 12th November 2025
* TOC update to 5.5.2

== v3.15 - 5th November 2025
* TOC Update to 1.15.8

== v3.14 - 3rd October 2025
* TOC update to 11.2.5

== v3.13 - 26th September 2025
* TOC update to 5.5.1

== v3.12 - 2nd August 2025
* TOC update to 11.2.0

== v3.11 - 27th July 2025
* Dragons Tread Lightly now has increased accuracy for
  Classic Mists: What you will see will be a very small increase
  in precision on the continent maps and bigger improvement on
  the Azeroth map. DTL v1.03

== v3.10 - 22th July 2025
* Ensure that DB is correctly saved across AddOns
* AddOn compartment menus. This is Retail only
* Now using the modular event handling for pins
* More pin texture options

== v3.09 - 12th July 2025
* New fire pin. Nature colour, i.e. green
* Improvements to modularity
  (about to begin rolling out the latest improvements
  across all event AddOns)

== v3.08 - 30th June 2025
* Reworked pin sizes. A 25% default size increase in zones,
  continents get 75% of that and Azeroth 60% of that/ This
  seems good across all game versions. I still retain the
  upwards boost of x 1.3 for all Classic pins in all
  versions of Classic to be consistent with Blizzard's
  bigger icon approach
* Translations
  
== v3.07 - 29th June 2025
* Thief's reward now live for all game versions
* Internal move of code from Localisations_event into _Common
* Moved Azeroth check into Common_Functions
* Added a translation for "Show pins on the Azeroth map"
* Moved Mechagon off the Azeroth map. It looked weird
  (even if technically correctly located)
* Using new version of Dragons Tread Lightly v1.02

== v3.06 - 28th June 2025
* Arathi Highlands now warns you if you are in the wrong phase.
  Please note the the game is WRONG to show the fire quest
  question mark on the World Map. They ain't there in the
  present time. The reason the game is wrong is likely due to
  the programmer not realising that there are TWO buffs to
  test! The buff you get upon flying into the zone and the
  buff you get after switching with Zidormi. Maybe that in
  itself is a bug. Dunno. Took me a while to realise. My
  previous attempts to code Arathi never worked reliably
  which was why it was missing lol!
  
== v3.05 - 26th June 2025
* Quests now appear in the continent summary pins for
  Vanilla
* Dragons Tread Lightly is now at v1.01. Pandaria coordinates
  are based off actual calculations rather than vision

== v3.04 - 25th June 2025
* Classic Vanilla

== v3.03 - 25th June 2025
* "Got Khaz Algar done properly" famous last words. Sigh

== v3.02 - 24th June 2025
* Got Khaz Algar done properly
* Maelstrom/Deepholm improved slightly by bypassing HN/HBD
  and using my own DTL
* Altered the colour scheme sligthly. One of the heading
  colours is much redder now
* Classic Mists of Pandaria. Yeah I know it's only beta
* Classic Cataclysm
* I had to add my "hack" to work around the HandyNotes module
  Here Be Dragons not working in Classic Cata. Used the same hack
  as in my APLT AddOn - actually it is a ton more economical.
  For safety in case HN/HBD is ever updated I continue using it
  for Cata and Retail as the programmer in charge of HBD is much
  better than me and can decrypt/datamine the game files whereas
  all I do is provide visual based translations of coordinates
* Altered show/not show logic for Azeroth pins: allows for the
  noAzeroth flag in the data file

== v3.01 - 23rd June 2025
* More textures to choose from for display
* Mapping file is now used (Preparation for Cata/Mists)
* Summary pin clusters as I typically do in other AddOns
* Logic improvements. Had to place a few achievements into
  an exception table (anticipated problem)
* Data coding error in Khaz Algar prevented Horde players
  from seeing pins
* Added translations

== v3.00 - 22nd June 2025
* New coding for 2025
* More to come. This version only mimics the old 2024 version
  (with corrections for Warbanding etc etc)

== v2.08 - 18th June 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.7

== v2.07 - 20th April 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.5

== v2.06 - 20th February 2025
* TOC update to 11.1.0

== v2.05 - 2nd February 2025
* Better Refresh delay to prevent that annoying GetAchievementCriteriaInfo abend

== v2.04 - 7th January 2025
* Added another HandyNotes Refresh() delay for logins (both new and character swap),
  reloads, and loading screen situations (various - enter/exit instances or Mage
  teleport, etc). This will assist players with slow internet, unusual Blizzard
  server glitches, too many AddOns, potato PCs
  Note: This is a preemptive change due to a report for another of my AddOns
	
== v2.03 - 24th December 2024
* The Refresh() timer now checks every 7 seconds to avoid server issues when the
  API is unreliable during loading screens.
  Note: This is a preemptive change due to a report for another of my AddOns

== v2.02 - 10th December 2024
* TOC update to 11.0.7

== v2.01 - 26th November 2024
* Minimap pins now disappear/appear around the same time as they do on the World Map
  I arbitrarily set the timer to checking every 3 seconds - to avoid FPS / DPS hits
  If show/hide via the options panel then that's instant
  If in combat then I rely wholly on the HandyNotes engine to avoid taint errors
  (a main reason I moved to the HN ecosystem years ago)
* Maladath added to the OCE server list

== v2.00 - 29th October 2024
* Slash/chat commands added

* TOC update to 10.1.5

== v1.08 - 1st July 2023
* Zidormi suggestions and help throughout
