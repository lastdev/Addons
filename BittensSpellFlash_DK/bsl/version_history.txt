* c.PriorityFlash() now prints the flashing spell to debug output.

== Version 4.2.1

This version has updates that apply to almost every class, and is necessary for the latest Warlock release.  One change could have subtle quirks for any class if I got it wrong, so please notify me right away if something seems a little off after the update.
* Changed AoE color from purple to more bluish.  It will not be quite as easy to distinguish from white (the single-target color), but much easier to distinguish from red (which more and more modules are using).
* Changed c.IsCasting() to work around a bug in WoW.
* Added c.DistanceAtTheLeast() and c.DistanceAtTheMost().
