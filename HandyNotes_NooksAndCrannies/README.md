This addon will sometime contain all caves, portals and another modes of transportation around the World (of Warcraft).

If you have any comment, issue or feature request, you can leave me a note on Discord (link in icon), create issue on Gitlab or send me a message where you see fit.

## Configuration

Configuration for this addon can be found under HandyNotes (Interface -> Addons -> HandyNotes -> Plugins -> Nooks and Crannies).

Each point has its own contextual menu (right click) with options to navigate and hide.

At current time, you can modify configuration for Waypoints.

### Waypoints

You can change size and opacity of waypoints in instances and on world maps.

## Features

### Waypoints in instances

This adds waypoints (transitions between maps) to past dungeons and raids like we know it from Legion and onwards.
In the future, this might be expanded to mini maps all over the world (like Caverns of Time).

- Waypoints in all __pre-Legion__ raid instances for easier orientation:
  - __Classic__ raids (_Blackwing Lair, Temple of Ahn'Qiraj_).
  - __Burning Crusade__ raids (_Karazhan, Black Temple, Sunwell Plateau_).
