# BankStack

## [v2025.7](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-bankstack/tree/v2025.7) (2025-12-19)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-bankstack/compare/v2025.6...v2025.7) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/kemayo/wow-bankstack/releases)

- TOC for 11.2.7, 5.5.3, 1.15.8  
- Avoid an error with command parsing from auto-stacking at the bank  
- Slashcommands will now accept macro conditions  
    E.g. `/sort [mod:alt] account; [mod:shift] guild; bank` will function to  
    sort various different things depending on the modifiers you hold while  
    running it. I imagine this won't be terribly useful outside of macros.  
    If anyone finds a use for things like `[harm]`, go nuts. :-P
