Reagent Restocker is a simple addon for automatically purchasing items, selling
unwanted items, and repairing. Unlike many other similar addons, Reagent
Restocker supports drag and drop and has a full GUI for editing buy/sell lists.

If you like it, feel free to donate! I highly recommend donating to your
favorite addons, it really helps. **If every person who downloads this addon
donates as little as \$1 per month, I could actually work on this addon full
time.** As it stands, however, it's actually kinda hard to justify putting much
time into it at all.

Reagent Restocker now has [Google+][1] and [Facebook][2] pages! News, notes, and
patch releases will be posted to Google+ and Facebook.

NOTE: I've been seeing copies of Reagent Restocker popping up at other download
sites. The only three places I currently upload the addon to are curse.com,
wowinterface.com, and solidice.com. I cannot guarantee the integrity of any
other download sites.

 

What can you do with Reagent Restocker? Well, you can do the following:

-   Automatically buy items from vendors.

-   Automatically sell items you can't use.

-   Automatically fix your gear.

-   Warn you when you're getting low on items you automatically buy.

-   Use LDB to show your current stock of items.

-   Automatically mark items in ArkInventory as trash (Note: This feature is
    maintained by the authors of ArkInventory).

-   Access it via the minimap (must have LibDBIcon installed).

-   When automatically buying water, it can automatically update the buy list to
    the latest usable water by your character.

-   Stock excess items in your bank or the guild bank.

-   Control buying/selling/repairing based on vendor discounts.

 

Devs wanted! It's open source, and I've been busy with other things in real
life. I'm willing to add more members to the team. Must have a CurseForge
account.

 

### Usage

If you have LibDBIcon or a LDB compatible bar installed, you can access Reagent
Restocker simply by clicking on the icon. Otherwise, you can access it via slash
commands.

To start using Reagent Restocker, type

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/rr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

at the command line.

/rrstock and /reagentrestocker also work.

Raid Roll users: Reagent Restocker may take over /rr - if that happens, use /rrl
for Raid Roll.

/rrbuy and /rrsell add items to the sell and buy lists (thanks g3gg0)

 

### NOTE

The primary portal for Reagent Restocker is at curse.com, even though I also
publish the addon to wowinterface.com (the old portal) and solidice.com, and may
publish to other places in the future.
