Donation policy:

General rule of thumb: All donations basically go to supporting this addon in some way or another.

* Most donations basically go towards the WoW subscription and premium memberships at addon websites.
* There is a new WoW addon development book, donations will go towards that.
* Anything remaining donations goes towards making it easier to dedicate time to Reagent Restocker.

If everybody who downloads gives even a minimal amount of money to their favorite addons every month or so, that would be great and do a lot for the addon community.
